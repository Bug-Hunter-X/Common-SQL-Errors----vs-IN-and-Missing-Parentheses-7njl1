In SQL, a common mistake is to use the `=` operator instead of `IN` when checking if a value exists within a set of values. This can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with multiple values.  For example, if you want to select rows where a column 'id' is in (1, 2, 3), using `WHERE id = (1, 2, 3)` will not work as expected.  Instead you should use `WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3)`. Another common mistake is forgetting to close the parentheses when using subqueries or functions.   This can lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior.
