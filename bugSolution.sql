The corrected SQL code uses the `IN` operator for checking if a value is present in a set of values, and ensures proper use of parenthesis in subqueries and functions. For Example:

-- Incorrect use of = operator
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = (1,2,3); -- Wrong! 

-- Correct use of IN operator
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id IN (1,2,3); -- Correct!

-- Missing closing parenthesis in subquery
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA' ; -- Wrong!

-- Correct subquery
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA'); -- Correct!
